<h1>Exercise</h1>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>Using <strong>iteration</strong>, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].</p> 
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem <strong>recursively</strong>. This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
